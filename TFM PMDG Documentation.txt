** Intro
	This is a documentation of all the keystrokes for the PMDG 737 NGX CDU within Talking Flight Monitor. This list will be expanded as more code is put into the project.

**Documentation Format
	To help those understand the key combonation presses for the CDU, I will be formatting them like so. DescriptionOfKeyStroke .. KeyStroke. Furthermore, the documentation will be split into sections marked by a double asterisk, and subsections marked by a tripple asterisk.  So without further ado lets get started!
